# Simple-calculator
- A simple calculator program made in py.
- Took less than 15 minutes to make.
- Does multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, roots and powers.
- Feel free to copy the code and use it for your own purposes.

+ Here's the overview:

  + I've used three imports, time, sys and math

  + I've used functions for each 'process' as I've called the +, -, * and /.

  + Error catching is present. Errors will be caught if the user types something other than what is required.

  + The code may look a little longer than expected due to the above reason.

  + I've used a math import for easier 'processes' such as roots and powers.
